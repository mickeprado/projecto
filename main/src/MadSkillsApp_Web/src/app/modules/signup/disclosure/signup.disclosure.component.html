    </ol>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.1 These provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or access, download and use or Services in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or download or use or Services from outside the United States. See below for more detail.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Service, our customer support team should be your first point of contact. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.3 Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach a mutually agreed solution within a period of 30 days from the time initial dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms and the Privacy Policy (including its interpretation, formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA") shall apply to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and formation of these terms notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in these terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of these terms or the Privacy Policy is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and, to the extent applicable, the Consumer Minimum Standards, including the then-current limit on arbitration filing fees. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.4 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Denver County, Colorado, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Denver County, Colorado, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.5 The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action to seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.6 Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Services under these terms. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.7 You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the paragraphs above by sending us written notice of your decision to opt-out. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your commencement of use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as provided for herein. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>

    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">15.8 We will provide 60-days' notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>

    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising identifiers to enable and optimize their advertising. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and Apple's ID for advertising ("IDFA"). We and third-parties who advertise on our Service may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in advertising. These technologies operate either by placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or mobile device and/or by accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection of data, such as your device's model, operating system and screen size, the other applications installed on your device, and information about how you use our services.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device. They are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites, and these cookies are both our own and third-party cookies, such as Google Analytics.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for internet-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary based-upon device, but usually you will find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings. You can disable cookies through your web or mobile browser settings.</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">Although we and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to enable us and third-parties to provide more relevant advertising to you, these technologies also:</p>

Also, please note that adjusting your preferences as described above does not mean that you will not receive advertisements, it only means the advertisements you do see will be less relevant to you.

    <p class="terms-conditions-paragraph">With regard to Do Not Track signals, there is currently no accepted standard on how to respond to these signals, and we do not respond to them. We do not collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Therefore, Do Not Track signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our Service, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such signal. You may learn about how to opt-out of having your data used for online behavioral advertising with advertisers who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting aboutads.info/choices (for US customers). Another available tool is the Network Advertising Initiative's ("NAI") opt-out tool at networkadvertising.org/choices.
